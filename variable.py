# example of variable(string,int,float,boolean)
name="Aman"
age=20
discout=20.4
is_std=True

print(name,age,discout,is_std)
print(f"your name is {name} and your age is {age}");  #this is called fstring

# now for boolean
if is_std:
    print("yes you are student")
else:
    print("no you arent")

# now type()function to check their type like int,str
print(type(name))
print(type(is_std));  #remember one thing we can convert any type of expect character
